        \ruleline{\textbf{About me}}
        I am an electronics \& embedded engineer with 4 years of professional experience working with on a variety projects, from small prototypes and proof of concepts, to larger commercial products. \\

        I enjoy solving problems and learning new skills, especially those related to embedded systems. \\
        
        I currently specialise in developing Embedded Linux Systems for vision and AI applications for educational, industrial and commercial use. On these systems, I have been responsible for designing their PCBs by implementing analog, digital and RF components, creating elements of their BSP, writing and testing kernel drivers, diagnosing hardware, firmware and software issues, and packaging and optimising applications for said systems.

        \MySectionNoPic{SEP 2021 - Today}{AIoT Engineering Manager}{St. Julians, Malta}{SmartCow}{I now lead a small team of Embedded Linux and Electronics Engineers to quickly develop and test hardware, firmware \& software features related to SmartCow's products. This can range from recommending components to be incorporated into our products and contributing to elements of a product's schematic and PCB from the hardware aspect, developing the BSP by creating device drivers, device trees, recipes for build systems and custom kernel modules and kernel configurations from the firmware side, and writing applications to be deployed on the devices, to testing, packaging and deploying software for these devices. \\
        
        To achieve this, I have frequent interactions and consultations with various other teams to improve product viability. Such a position gives me vast knowledge about the product lifecycle, which I share by creating training documents and courses for both internal and external use. This also puts me in a prime position to represent the company at various exhibitions and expos in Europe and the Middle East to discuss our products and their use cases to potential clients and industry peers, as well as to help produce presentations, blog posts and product videos for marketing purposes and sales pitches.}

        \MySectionNoPic{JUN 2021 - SEP 2021}{AIoT Engineer}{St. Julians, Malta}{SmartCow}{Initially joining as a Machine Learning engineer, I quickly transitioned to the AIoT engineer role to fill in a knowledge gap within the company; where I would rapidly develop and test hardware prototypes to determine their viability as fully fledged products, as well as to thoroughly test and document newly announced software features related to the NVIDIA Jetson platform.}  

        \vspace*{0.22cm}
            
        \MySectionNoPic{MAR 2020 - JUN 2021}{Student Engineer}{L-Imrieħel, Malta}{Methode Electronics Malta Ltd.}{Here I helped to improve the functionality of various systems and processes in the SMT department, which focuses on automotive PCB assembly. Projects included a backup system for a number of critical Unix, Windows and Linux systems, and optimisation of a laser system for barcode etching on assembled PCBs.}

        \MySectionNoPic{AUG 2020 - FEB 2021}{Research Student}{Geneva, Switzerland}{CERN}{I had the absolutely incredible opportunity to work with the European Organization for Nuclear Research's (CERN) Mechatronics \& Robotics department as part of my Master's Degree. The main project was to implement a vision based anomaly detection system to scan the interior surface of superconducting RF cavities. As part of my work, I designed a PCB to provide custom functionality and implemented signal processing and machine learning algorithms to identify anomalous areas in the captured images.}

        \MySectionNoPic{JUL 2019 - SEP 2019}{Research Student}{Burgdorf, Switzerland}{Bern University of Applied Sciences}{I was responsible for the prototyping of two low-cost, low-power IoT systems with Bluetooth connectivity. My duties include performing simulations and cost studies of the proposed circuits, designing and assembling PCBs and performing a full characterisation on the completed systems. I also developed a library that abstracted many of the low level routines of the utilised STM microcontroller.}
